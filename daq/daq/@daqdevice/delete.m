function delete(obj,event)
%DELETE Remove data acquisition objects from the engine.
%
%    DELETE(OBJ) removes object, OBJ, from the data acquisition engine.
%    If any channels or lines are associated with OBJ, they are also 
%    deleted.  OBJ can be either a device array or a channel/line.
%
%    If OBJ is the last object accessing the identified hardware, the
%    associated hardware driver and driver specific adaptor are closed 
%    and unloaded.
%
%    Using CLEAR removes OBJ from the workspace only.
%  
%    DELETE should be used at the end of a data acquisition session.
%
%    If OBJ is running, DELETE(OBJ) will delete OBJ and a warning 
%    will be issued.  If OBJ is running and logging/sending, DELETE(OBJ)
%    will not delete OBJ and an error will be returned.
%
%    If multiple references to a data acquisition object exist in the 
%    workspace, deleting one reference will invalidate the remaining 
%    references.  These remaining references should be cleared from 
%    the workspace.
%
%    Example:
%      ai = analoginput('winsound');
%      aiCopy = ai;
%      delete(ai)  % Removes ai from the data acquisition engine.
%                  % aiCopy is now an invalid object.
%
