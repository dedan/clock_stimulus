function wait(obj, waittime)
%WAIT Wait for the data acquisition object to stop running.
%
%    WAIT(OBJ,WAITTIME) waits for the OBJ's Running property to go
%    to 'Off'. The WAITTIME specifies the maximum time in seconds to
%    wait before causing a time out error.  It is not guaranteed that the 
%    OBJ's StopFcn will be called before this function returns.
%    OBJ can be either a single device object or an array of device objects.
%    When OBJ is an array of objects then this function will wait on each 
%    object separately and therefore could wait for up to N times the WAITTIME
%    where N is the number of objects passed in.
%    If the object is not running or has an error this function will return
%    immediately.
%
%    OBJ can stop running under one of the following conditions:
%       1. When the requested samples are acquired (analog input) or sent 
%          out (analog output).  For analog input, this occurs when OBJ's
%          SamplesAcquired equals the product of OBJ's SamplesPerTrigger 
%          and TriggerRepeat properties.
%       2. A runtime error occurs.
%       3. OBJ's Timeout value is reached.
%
%    The Stop event is recorded in OBJ's EventLog property.
