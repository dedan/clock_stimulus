function obj = loadobj(B)
%LOADOBJ Load filter for data acquisition objects.
%
%    OBJ = LOADOBJ(B) is called by LOAD when a data acquisition object  
%    is loaded from a .MAT file. The return value, OBJ, is subsequently 
%    used by LOAD to populate the workspace.  
%
%    LOADOBJ will be separately invoked for each object in the .MAT file.
